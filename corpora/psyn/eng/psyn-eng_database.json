        "summary": "This study explores how neurodivergent identities interact with race, gender, and sexual orientation to impact mental health symptoms like depression and anxiety. Using data from over 14,000 clients in a virtual mental health program, the study found significant interaction effects—particularly with gender and sexuality—but not with race. It highlights the importance of identity-affirming care to improve treatment equity and outcomes.",
